Imagine this spritesheet, containing each 'slice' of a 3-dimensional frog character:\

Displaying the frog character as a series of individual frames:\

Open the Stacked Sprite Visualizer and prepare to generate the stack:\

Installation Steps:
1. Make sure you're on Aseprite version 1.3+
2. Download this repository (Click Code->Download ZIP)
3. In Aseprite, find your scripts folder via File->Scripts->Open Scripts Folder
4. Copy "Stacked Sprites Visualizer.lua" into the Aseprite Scripts folder
5. In Aseprite, reload scripts via File->Scripts->Rescan Scripts Folder
6. You should now see the Visualizer in File->Scripts

Notes:
- I've included an example stacked sprite frog to play around with
- Try to make each frame size the same width and height (ex: 32x32 rather than 32x24)
- This script hasn't been tested very much, so please keep backups of your work just in case
